# Tools

Development tools for the Synheart Behavior SDK.

## Available Tools

As the Behavior SDK develops, tools may be added for:

- **Test data generator**: Generate synthetic interaction patterns for testing
- **Privacy validation**: Verify no content/PII is captured
- **Performance benchmarks**: Measure event processing latency and resource usage
- **Behavioral pattern analysis**: Analyze and visualize interaction patterns
- **Cross-platform testing**: Test consistency across SDKs

## Contributing

When adding new tools:

1. Create a dedicated directory for complex tools
2. Add a README.md explaining the tool's purpose and usage
3. Update this main README with tool information
4. Ensure tools work across all supported platforms
5. Add CI/CD integration where appropriate

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
